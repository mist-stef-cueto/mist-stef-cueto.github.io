						<p>Scan through the different snacks and check whether
						there is something that might satisfy your cravings.
						The types of products that you can buy vary from machine 
						to machine; however, most of them include some kind of chips, 
						chocolates, cookies, and gums. Some machines offer healthy 
						snacks such as baked chips, granola bars, and peanuts.</p>

						it might be convenient to try to visually double check the
						expiration date of the snack you want to buy.</p>
